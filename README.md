## Features

### Screens and Process Flows

user-credits includes screens and process flows for handling offers, offer groups, order management, payment tracking, and credit consumption. The library's flexibility allows it to be used with various view technologies, such as React, Vue, or others, empowering you to build UIs according to your preferred technology.

### Offers and Offer Groups

- **Offers:** With user-credits, you can create and manage offers, allowing you to define different pricing models, discounts, and customizations. It includes features like offer overriding, enabling tailored pricing for specific user groups or offer groups.

- **Offer Groups:** Examples of offer groups include monthly or yearly billing with sale prices for yearly billing or exclusive offers for users who subscribe to a specific offer group, such as "Insurance" or "Online Course."

### Order Management and Payment

- **Order and Payment:** Users can easily order and pay for offers through user-credits. The library handles the entire order and payment process, allowing users to follow the progress and confirmation of their payments.

- **Subscription Management:** user-credits supports different use cases of offers, including subscription-based offers, consulting offers, and token-based offers.

### Token-Based Offers

- **Token-Based Offers:** Token-based offers provide users with a certain number of credits. These credits can be consumed by related services or products. Users can track their credit consumption for each offer they've purchased.

- **Stats and Monitoring:** user-credits offers detailed statistics and monitoring capabilities, allowing users to see the current state of each token-based offer, making it easy to keep track of their credit usage.

### Multi-Currency Support

user-credits allows you to display orders and prices in multiple currencies, making it suitable for a global audience. While currency conversion is not built-in, user-credits offers seamless integration to sync and manage international payments effortlessly.

## Usage

The user-credits's primary goal is to enable you to define how data should be represented in a UI-agnostic manner. It provides two essential components, Resolver and Element Builder, to achieve this goal.

### Resolver

The Resolver is at the core of user-credits. It allows you to resolve data and define how it should be presented based on a given domain. Here's how you can use it:

```javascript
import { Resolver } from 'user-credits';

const resolver = new Resolver();

// To resolve an offer
const offerData = {/* Your offer data here */};
const offerProps = resolver.getObject({ type: 'Offer' }, offerData);
```

### Element Builder

Element Builder is an abstraction layer that handles the data-to-UI transformation of each field individually. It allows you to define how each field should be presented, including default values. Here's how you can use it:

```javascript
import { ElementBuilder } from 'user-credits';

const elementBuilder = new ElementBuilder();

// Build properties for an element
const elementProps = elementBuilder.buildElementProps('div', data, 'my-element-class');

// Build properties for a list of elements
const listProps = elementBuilder.buildListBlockProps('ul', listData, 'my-list-class');

// Transform data to a string representation
const stringValue = elementBuilder.asString(data);
```

## Example Implementation

The user-credits offers a practical example for implementing offer-related screens in a UI-agnostic way. You can adapt this example to your specific use case. For full details, please refer to the example implementation in the source code.
